# Array Histogram

For this PHP code exercise, create a file named `histogram.php`. This file should contain a function named `histogram()` which accepts one parameter. This parameter *must* be an array. 

Given an array, `histogram()` will return an associative array of values from the given array as keys and their count as value.

For example, given `['a', 'a', 'b', 4]`, `histogram()` should return `['a' => 2, 'b' => 1, 4 => 1]`.

**Note:** for this exercise, you can assume that all values within the given array are integers or strings.
